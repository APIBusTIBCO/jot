Jot
===

Quick note taking bookmark. Copy once and it's there when you need it. 

Instructions
=======
Copy all text from [jot.html](https://github.com/mattohagan/jot/blob/master/jot.html) and paste into the URL box, then proceed to bookmark.


Idea from [this Snippet Repo](http://snippetrepo.com/snippets/one-line-browser-notepad)

Background images taken from [this imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/MBJlE) full of pictures from the Momentum Chrome Extenstion.
- Couldn't use imgur API due to XHR not working in 'one-line' bookmark.
- will be weeding out non working images


To Add
- local storage
- basic j logo
- minified & easier to copy text
